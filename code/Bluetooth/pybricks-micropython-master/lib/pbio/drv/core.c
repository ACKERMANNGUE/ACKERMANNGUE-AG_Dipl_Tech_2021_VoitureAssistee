 * actually turn off until the button is released and the USB cable is disconnected
 * on Powered Up hubs, so we need to make it look like the power is off already
 * so that users will know when to release the button.
 *
 * Some drivers still need to be useable after this, like reset and battery
 * charger drivers.
