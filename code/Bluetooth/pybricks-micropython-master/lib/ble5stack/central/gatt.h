 *
 * @par Corresponding Events
 * If the return status from this function is @ref bleSUCCESS and the GATT client
 * succesfully sends an acknowledgement,  the calling

 * When this command is received, the host will send the CommandStatus Event.
 * The following status values can be received from the CommandStatus Event:
 *  @ref bleSUCCESS : Indication was queued successfully.
 *  @ref INVALIDPARAMETER
 *  @ref MSG_BUFFER_NOT_AVAIL
 *  @ref bleNotConnected
 *  @ref blePending : A confirmation is pending with this server.
 *  @ref bleInvalidMtuSize : Packet length is larger than connection's MTU size.
 *  @ref bleMemAllocError
 *  @ref bleTimeout : Previous transaction timed out.
 *
 * @warning The payload must be dynamically allocated using @ref GATT_bm_alloc
